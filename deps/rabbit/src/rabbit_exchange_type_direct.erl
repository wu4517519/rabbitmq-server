%% rabbit_router:match_routing_key/2 uses ets:select/2 to get destinations.
%% ets:select/2 is expensive because it needs to compile the match spec every
%% time and lookup does not happen by a hash key.
%%
%% In contrast, route_v2/2 increases end-to-end message sending throughput
%% (i.e. from RabbitMQ client to the queue process) by up to 35% by using ets:lookup_element/3.
%% Only the direct exchange type uses the rabbit_index_route table to store its
%% bindings by table key tuple {SourceExchange, RoutingKey}.
