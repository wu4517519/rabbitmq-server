%% This module exposes the API of the {@link rabbit_feature_flags}
%% registry. The feature flags registry is an Erlang module, compiled at
%% runtime, storing all the informations about feature flags: which are
%% supported, which are enabled, etc.
%%
%% Because it is compiled at runtime, the initial source code is mostly
%% an API reference. What the initial module does is merely ask {@link
%% rabbit_feature_flags} to generate the real registry.

%% In this registry stub, most functions want to return `init_required' to let
%% {@link rabbit_ff_registry_wrapper} do the first time initialization.
%%
%% The inner case statement is here to convince Dialyzer that the function
%% could return values of type `__ReturnedIfUninitialized' or
%% `__NeverReturned'.
%%
%% If the function was only calling itself (`Call'), Dialyzer would consider
%% that it would never return. With the outer case, Dialyzer would conclude
%% that `__ReturnedIfUninitialized' is always returned and other values will
%% never be returned and there is no point in expecting them.
%%
%% In the end, `Call' is never executed because {@link
%% rabbit_ff_registry_wrapper} is responsible for calling the registry
%% function again after initialization.
%%
%% With both cases in place, it seems that we can convince Dialyzer that the
%% function returns values matching its spec.

    %% This function is here to trick Dialyzer. We want some functions

    %% booleans. The `-spec()` correctly advertises a return type of
    %% `boolean()`. But in the meantime, Dialyzer only knows about this
    %% copy which, without the trick below, would always return either
    %% `true` (e.g. in is_registry_written_to_disk/0) or `false` (e.g.
    %% is_registry_initialized/0). This obviously causes some warnings
    %% where the registry functions are used: Dialyzer believes that
    %% e.g. matching the return value of is_registry_initialized/0
    %% against `true` will never succeed.
    %%
    %% That's why this function makes a call which we know the result,

    %% value.
